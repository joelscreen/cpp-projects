# cpp-projects
## Description
a mix of different C++ projects that I made for practice

## How to use
You must have C++ along with CMake to use this. Most projects have a workspace, which you can debug to run, but some require CMake
```bash
cmake ..
```
or
```bash
cmake --build .
```

# Main Project - Build (currently in progress)
## Description
A multi-story based game, full of exciting adventures

## Base Story
Save the universe, which is under control over the mastermind villain, Zaine.  Explore bizarre planets in order to craft the orb, in order to find the power crystal, by which you can save the universe and destroy Zaine's master plan

## How to suggest a new story
You can email quantalstudios@outlook.com to suggest a new story. Don't worry! Even if your story doesn't get accepted, you can suggest an update for an existing story

I'm not looking forward to hiring people, as I want this to be a solo/indie game, however you can leave a suggestion at quantalstudios@outlook.com or pull a request on this repo.
