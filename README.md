# cpp-projects
## Description
a mix of different C++ projects that I made for practice

## How to use
You must have C++ along with CMake to use this. Most projects have a workspace, which you can debug to run, but some require CMake
```bash
cmake ..
```
or
```bash
cmake --build .
```

## Prerequisites
- CMake
- C++
- basic understanding of C++ and the library used in the project in case of errors or bugs
- optional: VSCode (as the projects are made in VSCode)

## Optional: Cloning the repo
You can clone this github repository by running this command in your git bash terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelscreen/cpp-projects.git
```

## What I'm working on now
- Space Defenders Infinity: A Space Invader with unique missions.

## Suggestion and bugs
Feel free to give suggestions on features or code organizing by pulling a request. If you have any projects that I can work on, please email. Also pull up an issue if you find any bugs or error in the code. Your issue will be responded asap.
